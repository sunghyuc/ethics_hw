    "\n",
    "In this assignment we explore the concepts of differential privacy (DP) and federated learning (FL) on a simple example dataset of Apple Watch data for multiple users. We will see how we can use DP to generate statistics and summaries of the data in a way that protects the raw data. Then we will use FL to train a model using each individual's Apple Watch data independently, as if that data were stored on each individual's device, and not centralized. Training a good model is **not** the point of this exercise, however, this data was collected, cleaned, processed, and modeled as part of an experiment, which you can read about [here](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-17022/v1/d5923374-d56c-4fe7-a036-949ecf41917e.pdf?c=1631831698) if you'd like. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this assignment, we will be more familiar with DP and FL. Note that this simple notebook is not enough to encapsulate all of the challenges with these topics. They are both very complex, so much so that many companies have not bothered to try implementing them.\n",

    "First we will load the data and quickly take a look at it to get a better understanding. We do not need to generate any summary statistics or histograms yet, we will do that in the next section. For more details on how this dataset was created, see [this](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-17022/v1/d5923374-d56c-4fe7-a036-949ecf41917e.pdf?c=1631831698).\n",

    "The data does not come with a unique identifier, so we will create one using the age, gender and height of the individuals under the assumption that no individual aged or got taller or shorter during the time this data was collected, and that no two individuals have identical ages, genders and heights. In future sections we will want to train some models, predicting the `activity_trimmed` column based on the user's watch measurements and their age, gender, height, and weight (which we might say are *sensitive* characteristics)."

    "Now we can train a very simplistic regularized logistic regression model on the centralized dataset. When we train the model, we want to easily compare it to a privacy-preserving version of the model that we will be training later, so let's simplify the data a little bit by bucketing our target variable, `activity_trimmed` into just two categories: `Still` and `Active`, and then we'll convert it to a binary (0,1) variable for classification. We also will not do any extensive feature selection, we can just do a quick LASSO model and select a few features to keep in the final model."

    "Now we can create our feature (X) and target (y) data for modeling. We'll use a simple random train/test split even though we know that a user's data may end up in both sets, which may result in leakage. Like we said earlier, the goal here isn't to train a very good model. But, if we were doing this properly we might identify data from each user that we can use as an out-of-time test data set by choosing the most recently recorded data (unfortunately, datetime is not included in the dataset), and allow the model to train on a portion of each user's data. Or, maybe we exclude a sample of our users' data entirely from training and only include those users in the testing set to see if a model that is trained on one set of users can be used to predict on other sets of users.

    "Now that we have our statistics and a trained model using the full dataset, with no privacy, we can compare the results with the results we would get using DP. We will only be using Central DP (CDP) in these examples, and will not do anything with Local DP (LDP). The difference between CDP and LDP is that with CDP we have a trusted central server that is responsible for taking any aggregates of the raw data (e.g. mean, median) and adding noise to the aggregates in order to avoid any leakage of the underlying data. With LDP, the noise is added before aggregating, on the client side, which reduces some risk of leakage, but also tends to result in less accurate summaries.\n",

    "There are many concepts and properties of DP that we will not be covering, such as sensitivity, $\\epsilon-\\delta$ DP, privacy budget, and the different randomization mechanisms we can use to add noise. If this is a topic that interests you, I encourage you to do more research. "

    "Federated learning is when models are trained on datasets that have **not** been collected together into a single training set, i.e. the data is federated, or distributed, across devices or databases, and there is no sharing or moving of data between devices. There is a single global model that needs to be trained on the federated data by training smaller models locally on the device itself, and then only the weights (or gradients) will be shared back to a central server that hosts the main global model. Those weights are then aggregated in some way to update the global model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few python libraries that can demonstrate federated learning, but they tend to have a steep learning curve since federated learning is very complex. Instead, let's just implement it from scratch in a simplistic way using the ID that we created from the dataset before."

    "In this next step, now that we've divided our training data into several training sets using the unique IDs, is to train LASSO models using only the data from each ID (ignoring the data in the test set). Then, we can implement the simplest version of federated learning called FederatedAveraging, which you can read about [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf). In a nutshell, we let each *client* or device train a local model, in parallel, and return the *weights* or coefficients to the server. Then, the server takes a weighted average of the coefficients, weighted by the size of the data on each client.\n",

If you'd prefer a slightly more realistic scenario you can look at the [`flwr`](https://flower.ai/) library which will actually simulate the different clients and the server by running them all in separate terminals."

    "In the above notebook we were able to demonstrate in simple terms the concepts of DP and FL on a dataset of Apple Watch data for multiple users. Remember that we implemented the most simplistic versions of both of these concepts, and we did everything on our local machines. These are fairly complex topics, and FL in particular can be extremely difficult to implement in a real production environment, hence the main reason it is not more popularly used in industry outside of larger tech companies that can afford to hire people with expertise in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we did not discuss it in much detail, there are weaknesses with the amount of privacy that is guaranteed by FL and DP. There may still be ways to reconstruct raw data instances with FL, and with DP the amount of privacy is dependent on $\\epsilon$. In FL, we could go one step further in increasing privacy by implementing DP on the clients so that the actual weights sent back to the central server are differentially private, making it even more difficult to identify individual user's and their data.\n",

Please relate what was written in this piece to something you've personally experienced. Be sure to tie your experience to specific examples given in the text. I will be grading this one based on: (1) the personal experience you describe; (2) the clarity and organization of your response; and (3) the integration of the reading into your response.
